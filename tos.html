        <li>By using the App you grant Chatlith a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to process, host, and transmit your User Content to third-party providers (such as OpenAI and Firebase) for the purpose of providing the App’s services. This license is solely for operation, improvement, and maintenance of the App and its features.</li>

If you explicitly submit screenshots or feedback for promotional use, you grant Chatlith permission to use those submitted materials for marketing and promotional purposes.</li>

We may also report suspected criminal activity to law enforcement.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Current status:</strong> In-app purchases (IAP), subscriptions (Premium and Ultra), and their billing flows are integrated with Google Play and will be available once Google has reviewed and approved our app. While the App is awaiting final approval from Google, full IAP functionality may not be available.
